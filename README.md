# Fuck Trump
A Chrome extension to replace Donald Trump with ****** ***** and to replace pictures of his face with a plain gray box. Get it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/*****/oahajgphigbipdeclpinffdaadihblcg).

## Here's what it looks like
![In action](/Chrome_extension.png?raw=true "In action")

## Why did you build this?
* I just needed to get his name and face out of my line of sight for a while.
* Most name/image replacement extensions replace with photos of something cute, like kittens. The world doesn't feel super cute right now, and replacing with kittens just doesn't seem right.
* I wanted to practice getting something in the Chrome web store.

## If I had more time
* I'd do something about the pull requests that others have submitted.
